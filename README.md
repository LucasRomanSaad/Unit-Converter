# Unit Converter 

The Unit Conversion web application facilitates the quick conversion between metric and imperial units for length, volume, and mass. Users input a numerical value, and upon clicking the "CONVERT" button, the app calculates and displays the corresponding conversions in real-time. The application employs HTML for structuring the user interface, CSS for styling elements and providing a toggleable dark mode feature, and JavaScript for handling user interactions, performing calculations, and dynamically updating the displayed results. The dark mode functionality enhances user experience by offering an alternative color scheme for reduced eye strain in low-light environments. Overall, the app provides a convenient tool for users needing to convert between different measurement systems seamlessly.
